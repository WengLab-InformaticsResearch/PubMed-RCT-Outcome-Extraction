# PubMed-RCT-Outcome-Extraction
This repository contains 

1. a finalized annotation guideline for identifying outcome elements (O in PICO framework) in randomized controlled trial abstracts from PubMed ('Annotation Guideline Finalized.pdf') and 

2. a corpus of 640 randomized controlled trial abstracts from two corpora (500 RCT abstracts randomly selected and 140 RCT abstracts selected from the existing EBM-NLP corpus (https://github.com/bepnye/EBM-NLP)) that have been annotated per the annotation guideline by one primary annotator and two secondary annotators. The primary annotator and a secondary annotator reached a consensus on annotation for each of the abstracts. 

  i) A zipped consensus folder of all 640 abstract that contains both the abstract document (*.txt) and the    outcome annotations using the platform Brat (http://brat.nlplab.org/) in .ann format ('consensus.tar.gz').
  
  ii) For ease of use, abstracts from the two corpora are provided in CoNLL format as well ('500RCT-CoNLL.tsv'   and '140EBMNLP-CoNLL.tsv').
